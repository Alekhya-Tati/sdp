         <p1> Amaravathi is a village on the banks of the Krishna River, 
            in the Palnadu district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
             It is the headquarters of Amaravathi mandal,
              and forms part of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region with
               its headquarters at new Amaravati 35 km (22 mi) east,
                whose name is also borrowed from that of the older Amaravathi.
            Amaravathi was founded by Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu in the 1790s 
            as the new capital of his Zamindari estate. He moved there from his former 
            capital Chintapalli in protest of alleged mistreatment by the British East 
            India Company. Amaravathi is named after the ancient Amaravati Stupa, 
            which was unearthed in the process of the town's construction.It is adjacent
             to the ancient Satavahana capital Dhanyakataka (now called Dharanikota).
        Amaralingeswara temple in the village is one of the Pancharama Kshetras for Hindus.
         The place was also a historic Buddhist site, as shown by the presence of 
         Amaravati Stupa built during the second century BCE and the third century CE,
          as well as the Dhyana Buddha statue, a large 21st-century Buddha statue in Dhyana posture.
           It is one of the sites selected for the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana
            (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India, to preserve the rich cultural heritage of India.</p1>
