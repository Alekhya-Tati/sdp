There has been a lot of hype of Dudhsagar trek being closed for the general public. The Dudhsagar railway trek has been officially closed for the general public but the trek to the Dudhsagar falls bottom is still open for all.

There are two routes to reach there. One is starting the trek from Kulem and follow the jeep trail until the bottom of the waterfall. The second option is via the railway track which is roughly around 11 km. This trek is not allowed by the Government of Goa ( Forest Department) as it is very risk being a railway track with minimum safety. Anyone trekking along the Railway trek can be heavily fined and can even land you in Jail. You can trek up to the Sonaulim station and join back to the Mud route. This route would save 2 km on the Mud road. During the monsoon season, it is mandatory to hire a guide and get a life jacket in order to start the trek, otherwise the entry inside the forest is restricted because the area experiences extremely heavy rainfall, and the water displacement around the fall is potentially very large, so it is always better to carry a life jacket. It is advisable not to venture into the water at the base of the fall during monsoon as the flow of the water is very fast & dangerous.

The best time to visit the fall is between October to May as the access to the fall is open for the Jeep. This jeep can be hired from the local Dudhsagar Jeep Association counter at Collem. You have to pay as much as Rs. 500 per person for a jeep ride and maximum of seven people in one jeep. This jeep will take you to the base of the fall. You will have to pay Entry fees to the department of Forest to enter their area as this Falls comes under their jurisdiction. You get maximum of one & half hours to spend at the fall before you return back to the jeep you came by. The same jeep will then drop you back to Collem for your onward Journey. The Jeep safari is extremely fun and adventurous as there are chances of you seeing Wild life on the way.
