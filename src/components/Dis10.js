         <h1>Alhambra</h1>
         
         <p>
         Constructed on a plateau that overlooks the city of Granada, the Alhambra was built chiefly between 1238 and 1358, 
         in the reigns of Ibn al-Aḥmar, founder of the Naṣrid dynasty, and his successors. The splendid decorations of the
          interior are ascribed to Yūsuf I (died 1354). After the expulsion of the Moors in 1492, much of the interior was 
          effaced and the furniture was ruined or removed. Charles V, who ruled in Spain as Charles I , rebuilt portions in the
           Renaissance style and destroyed part of the Alhambra in order to build an Italianate palace designed by Pedro Machuca 
           in 1526. In 1812 some of the towers were blown up by a French force under Horace-François-Bastien Sébastiani during 
           the Peninsular War (War of Independence), and the rest of the buildings narrowly escaped the same fate. In 1821 an 
           earthquake caused further damage to the complex. An extensive repair and rebuilding program was undertaken in 1828 
           by the architect José Contreras and endowed by Ferdinand VII in 1830. After the death of Contreras in 1847, his son 
           Rafael continued his work for nearly four decades. Upon Rafael’s death in 1890, he was succeeded by his son, Mariano 
           Contreras Granja (died 1912). Additional restoration and conservation work continued through the 21st century.

           The Alhambra is situated in a locale of rare natural beauty. The plateau upon which it was built overlooks the Albaicín (Albayzin) quarter of Granada’s Moorish old city. At the base of the plateau, the Darro River flows through a deep ravine on the north. The park outside the palace (Alameda de la Alhambra) was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges, and myrtles. Its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought there in 1812 by the duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War.

Alicatado in the Tower of Comares, the Alhambra, Granada, Spain.

The lower entrance to the park is the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates),
 a massive triumphal arch dating from the 16th century. Just inside the gate is a statue of American author
  Washington Irving, which was erected in 2009, on the 150th anniversary of Irving’s death, to commemorate his role 
  in sparking interest in Spain’s Moorish past. A steep ascent leads past a fountain, erected in 1554, to the main
   entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta Judiciaria (Gate of Judgment), a horseshoe archway surmounted by a square tower, 
   which was used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. The Moorish portion of the Alhambra includes the Alcazaba, or
    citadel, which is the oldest part; only its massive outer walls, towers, and ramparts are left. Beyond the Alcazaba is the
     Alhambra palace and beyond that the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), which was originally tenanted by officials and courtiers
      and was part of a royal city constituting a seat of government.
