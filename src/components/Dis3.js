         Tokyo, Japanese Tōkyō formerly (until 1868) Edo, City capital of Japan. It is the country’s largest city 
         and is located in east-central Honshu at the head of Tokyo Bay. The site has been inhabited since ancient times. 
         The small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries before it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate 
         in 1603, at the start of the Edo (Tokugawa) period. By the 19th century it was one of the largest cities in the world,
          with a population exceeding 1,000,000. Under the Meiji Restoration, in 1868 it replaced Kyōto as the imperial capital, 
          and Edo was renamed Tokyo (“Eastern Capital”). A massive earthquake in the region in 1923 destroyed most of the city 
          and killed at least 100,000 people, but most of it had been rebuilt by 1930. Much of it was again devastated by
           U.S. bombing during World War II and had to be reconstructed. The Summer Olympic Games were held there in 1964. 
           Tokyo is the administrative, cultural, financial, commercial, and educational centre of Japan and the focus of an 
           extensive urban complex that includes Kawasaki and Yokohama. Attractions include the Imperial Palace, encircled by 
           stone-walled moats and broad gardens, and numerous temples and shrines. There are some 150 institutions of higher 
           learning, including the University of Tokyo (1877).

        Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is situated at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu. 
        First developed into a city during the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when the site was known as Edo, Tokyo is 
        the core of the Tokyo-Yokohama Metropolitan Area, commonly called Greater Tokyo. The city is Japan's major 
        cultural centre as well as its main transportation hub.
