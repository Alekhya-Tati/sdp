England is a country that's deeply rooted in tradition, history, pageantry, and pomp. 
Little surprise, then, that some of the biggest draws for tourists here revolve around the Royal Family, 
who have played an important role in shaping the country – along with many other parts of the world – for centuries
The country's principal tourist destinations are London, Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge, York, 
and Canterbury. The United Kingdom hosts a total of 32 World Heritage sites, the 8th most in the world.
