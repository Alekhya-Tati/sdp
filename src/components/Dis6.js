         The V&A Waterfront is an iconic mixed-use destination located in the oldest working harbour in the Southern Hemisphere. With Table Mountain as its backdrop, the 123-hectare neighbourhood sits within the beautiful city of Cape Town, welcoming millions of people from all over the continent and the rest of the world. The V&A is a symbol of heritage and diversity, where people from all walks of life can play, live, shop, dine and work while immersed in the vibrant spirit and authentic local culture that exists in this bustling ecosystem.

It sees its role on the continent to be a platform that facilitates and champions art and design, to support entrepreneurship and innovation, lead the charge on sustainability, and drive positive social and economic change. By prioritising people and the planet, the V&A is an example of how working with communities, respecting the environment and operating with passion and integrity is a better, more productive and kinder way of doing business.
This is the fifth bi-annual report to chronicle the economic contributions of the V&A. The report focuses on the economic value the V&A adds through the goods and services it produces, the jobs – and household income – it sustains, and the way it uses land. It covers the two years from April 2018 to March 2020 (financial years 2019 and 2020), the end date coinciding with South Africa’s strict COVID-19 lockdown.
