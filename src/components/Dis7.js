         The Auckland metropolitan area or Greater Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand, is the largest
          urban area of the country. With over 1.3 million people, it is home to nearly one-third of the country's population. 
          Demographic trends indicate that it will continue growing faster than the rest of the country. It is an 
          extensive urban area consisting of Auckland City (excluding the Hauraki Gulf islands), North Shore City, and the 
          urban parts of Waitakere and Manukau cities, along with Papakura District and some nearby urban parts of Rodney and 
          Franklin Districts.

Auckland has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the worldas well as its country's greatest concentration of indigenous Maori.

Auckland lies between the Hauraki Gulf of the Pacific Ocean to the east, the low Hunua Ranges to the south-east, the Manukau Harbour to the south-west, and the Waitakere Ranges and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow isthmus between the Manukau Harbour on the Tasman Sea and the Waitemata Harbour on the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the few cities in the world to have harbors on two separate major bodies of water. Known as the "City of Sails," Auckland has more yachts per capita than any other city in the world.
